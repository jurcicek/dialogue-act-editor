This project aims to develop editor, that significantly simplifies annotation process of transcribed spoken dialog. Annotation process was developed to maximize inter-annotator agreement and annotation reliability. Editor helps an annotator to speed up annotation process and to correct their typos and semantic nonsense in annotations.

The editor was mainly used for in the project [Extended HVS parser](http://code.google.com/p/extended-hidden-vector-state-parser/).

The used dialogue act and semantic annotation scheme is described in the chapter from my PhD thesis "[The human-human train timetable dialogue corpus](http://extended-hidden-vector-state-parser.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/HHTT/the-semantic-corpus.html)".

There is annotation manual used to annotate the corpus ([in Czech](http://dialogue-act-editor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/guideToDAA.pdf)).

Screen shots of the DAE, you can find [here](http://extended-hidden-vector-state-parser.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/HHTT/the-semantic-corpus.html#SECTION001230000000000000000).
